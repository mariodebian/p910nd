Description: small printer daemon intended for diskless workstations
 p910nd is a small daemon that copies any data received on the port it
 is listening on to the corresponding printer port.
 .
 It is primarily intended for diskless Linux hosts running as printer 
 drivers but there is no reason why it could not be used on diskful hosts.
 .
 Port 9100 is copied to /dev/lp0, 9101 to /dev/lp1 and 9102 to /dev/lp2.
 The default is port 9100 to /dev/lp0.
